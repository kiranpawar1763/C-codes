/*Write a C program to input electricity unit charge and calculate the 
total electricity bill according to the given condition: 

-> For first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit ï‚·

-> For next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit 

-> For next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit 

-> For unit above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit 
An additional surcharge of 20% is added to the bill. 

How to calculate electricity bill using if else in C programming. Program to find electricity bill using if else in C. Logic to find net electricity bill in C program.  
Input as : 
Enter the electricity units consumed: 40
Output as :
Total electricity bill: Rs. 24.00
Input as :
Enter the electricity units consumed: 100
Output as :
Total electricity bill: Rs. 75.00*/
